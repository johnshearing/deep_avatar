## Charles.ai Sitting On The Constitutional Committee - Training The Constitution Into An a.i. Rather Than Coding It Into A Smart Contract

[quote="johnshearing, post:1, topic:144330, full:true"]
“Can’t Be Evil” and “Code is Law” are some of the first principles of Cardano.
[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9wAyW_EcDA&t=1462s), queued up to the correct moment, we hear Charles announcing his huge donation to Carnegie Mellon to work on a method of coding a constitution for Cardano into a smart contract. I [commented](https://forum.cardano.org/t/smart-constitution-for-cardano/97181) about this video back in March of 22

In the video, Charles calls this meta-governance and specifically states the following:

> There’s a question of how much should the ethics, the Integrity, the soul, and the intentions of the system be machine understandable because if they are machine understandable you can then build protocols that can actually operate on the intent and embed them as kind of a regulator of the system for all smart contracts.

I don’t think that ethics, integrity, soul, and intentions are likely to be machine understandable in any sort of rigorous mathematical way.

However almost all of us have had conversations with a.i. large language models such as ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, and Gemini. Talking with these a.i. is like talking to an intelligent person and we can speak to these machines about ethics, integrity, soul, and intentions.

Furthermore, these machines can take action such as opening a door if a particular person is recognized or deploying a smart contract if certain conditions of ethics, integrity, soul, and intentions are met.

This is why I am now imagining Charles.ai as an elected member of the Constitutional Committee. Charles.ai is a chatbot (a large language model) specially trained on all the technical data about Cardano, but more importantly, trained on all the transcripts from the many videos where Charles Hoskinson speaks. While very few people would agree that an a.i. can think or feel, we can prove that an a.i., if trained on the right data, will give the same response as a particular person for a wide range of questions.

I am currently working on two similar projects which is how I received the idea.
The [first project](https://forum.cardano.org/t/a-i-classifiers-zero-knowledge-proofs-without-zero-knowledge-cryptography/127052) uses individually owned a.i. that is government certified to tell the truth. This a.i. will vouch for the owner’s, voting privileges, or that the owner is old enough to drink, and so on, without revealing the owner,s identity.

Since there are many small problems to solve in order to create the certified a.i. witness described above, I decided to start out with an easier project. The objective is to create an a.i. chatbot that responds as if it were Abraham Hicks. Abraham Hicks is a spirit which is channeled through YouTube personality Esther Hicks. [Abraham Hicks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQD7pzu14UU) is always talking about manifesting money, good health, good relationships, art, and good ideas simply by deciding to be happy no matter the circumstances and by choosing to focus our attention on solutions rather than dwelling on problems. Anyway, I thought that having an Abraham Hicks chatbot would be extra helpful for manifesting the sovereign a.i. witness I described above. This chatbot is trained by scraping the transcripts from all the thousands of videos that Esther Hicks has created along with metadata about the videos. After a video transcript is downloaded, a local a.i. on my laptop adds punctuation to the transcript and also maintains the timestamps so that the chatbot can cite its own training data to tell us where it got its ideas from.

I do program but I am by no means a good programmer. No worries though because free a.i. LLMs like claude, gemini, grok, and chatGPT do all the coding. I just tell them what I want and they write the programs and then debug them if I am having any problems. Sometimes one of them will get stuck on a problem. When that happens I just ask another a.i. to solve the issue. One of them always comes through. We are making great progress on the Abraham Hicks chatbot.

I hope there are no problems with intellectual property rights. I don’t see how there could be. After all, Abraham Hicks is a spirit. Is it possible for one person to copywrite the things a spirit says? Anyway, I am not trying to sell anything. This is just an experiment (a baby step) on the way to the sovereign a.i. witness and identity management bot.

Well yesterday it dawned on me that an a.i. fine-tuned on Charles Hoskinson’s video transcripts would likely make the same governance decisions that Charles himself would make given the same information on a constitutional issue.

Of course there are problems to solve before we allow an a.i. to run for office.
Before a model can be fine-tuned on Charles related materials, the base model must first be trained on an enormous dataset. The creation of that dataset, the method of training, and the behavior of the base model must be decided on by the community in thoughtful way. And how the model is fine-tuned and how information and questions are presented to the a.i. must be decided on and enforced in a decentralized manner.

These challenges create opportunity for our community. Imagine a “proof of useful work” or a “proof of learning” consensus mechanism which grants Cardano miners and or Cardano stake pool operators the right to make a block after proving they have processed a certain amount of training cycles on an approved a.i. base model.

Perhaps our best path to a machine understandable constitution that takes into account the ethics, integrity, soul, and intentions of our community, as Charles imagines, is not to hardcode it into a smart contract, but rather to soft code Charles into an a.i.

## Advantages Of Non-deterministic ai Over Deterministic Formal Proof Systems For Making The Cardano Constitution Machine Understandable

We certainly want our smart contracts to be deterministic. We need to know that they will do exactly what we expect them to do. Among the best features of Cardano is the Haskell based Plutus programming language which makes our smart contracts provably secure and correct before they are deployed. At this video link we see the Lean formal proof system being used to prove that Haskell code is correct. This is a perfect application for Lean.

Unlike smart contracts, governance should not be deterministic. If you know in advance how a governance system will respond (if it is deterministic) then you can game the system. All of game theory is base on the idea that if actors are rational then you know in advance what they will do and you can take advantage of that vision into the future to produce your own desired outcome.

That is why many of our political leaders appear to be unpredictable and even irrational. To be sure, these people calculate every move. However they will often obscure their plans, hide intentions and act irrational so as not to be anticipated by their opponents.

But the best political leaders are not deceptive and yet still they can not be anticipated.
This is possible because they are so creative, that they think of wildly new ways to solve problems that simply defy anticipation. It is this wildly creative non-determinism that we get from truly great leaders and this is the same kind of creative non-deterministic behavior that I am seeing as I work with ai.

One example of this creativity is when I asked Grok to write a script that would compare the audio of a YouTube video against the transcript of the same video and then mark up the transcript so that we would know who was speaking as the transcript was read. I told the ai that I only needed to identify the main speaker and suggested that a voice sample would be used to establish where in the transcript the main speaker was speaking. This is needed because the transcript will be used to train an ai to respond like Charles and so I need to label the training data to show when Charles is speaking or when others are asking him questions. The ai gave me the code snippet I asked for, but it also suggested that the main speaker was the one that was speaking for the greatest amount of time. So rather than relying on complicated voice sampling, it would be better simply to add up the amount of time that each speaker was speaking and then label the speaker with the greatest total speaking time as the main speaker (Charles).

I thought that the ai was very creative and helpful even though it did not do what I asked it to do.

This is the kind of helpful creativity I want to see from a machine that is interpreting the Cardano Constitution and deciding whether or not to allow a smart contract to be deployed on the chain or otherwise proceed. A non-deterministic ai can do this whereas a deterministic proof system can only do what it is asked to do.

So in order to prevent bad actors from guessing in advance what smart contracts they can slide past the machine as “in compliance” with the Cardano Constitution and in order to gain the unexpected solutions that a creative machine can provide, I suggest that a non-derministic Charles.ai be chosen over deterministic proof systems as the method to make the Cardano Constitution machine understandable and machine enforceable.

## A backup of Charles

[quote="johnshearing, post:3, topic:144330"]
So Charles is going on a risky adventure.
He leaves us this message in case he dies.

![](https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex023/uploads/cardano/original/3X/3/0/308be4adca4d9bfc39bff9afe91edbf6ff59db1f.jpeg "See you on the other side")

[ See you on the other side ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI7izd1Ky28)

At exactly 5 minutes into the video Charles mentions a company, of which he is invested, that has brought back the dire wolf from extinction.
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if our community could bring back Charles?
If it comes to that, I think we can.

I pray joyfully in anticipation of Charles’ safe return.
I pray joyfully because I know that the way in which bring our prayers to God makes a difference.

> **Mark 11:23-24 New International Version**
> 23 “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.
> 24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

You don’t need to squint too hard when watching Charles at 14:32 into his video to see that, in his own unique way, he understands the concept. The following is what he said:

> Ultimately we have to ask ourselves what is all this about. Why do we do what we do, and where do we want to go and manifest reality? Accordingly I’ve chosen to manifest a reality of my own. Making Cardano is the product of sheer willpower of many people who were told it couldn’t be done.

I am making progress on the Abraham Hicks chatbot which is my first step towards creating charles.ai.

So far I have a vector database created from 180 transcripts of Abraham Hicks YouTube videos.
This vector database is not an a.i. but it can be used to train or fine-tune an a.i. and it can be used by an a.i. to quote sources and give accurate results. So creating a vector database was my first task on my way to creating an Abraham Hicks chatbot.

I queried my database with the phrase “Positive expectations”, because that seems to be the theme of the day, and it returned the URLs of several Abraham Hicks videos along with snippets from the transcripts and relevant timestamps where that idea is expressed within the videos. Below is that list.

![image](upload://cecJfVUSqcGSLepvqEFWfWRVIrh)

I picked the video that seemed most relevant an queued it up near the place indicated by the database query.

![](https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex023/uploads/cardano/original/3X/7/4/74d9ba54b9f957b334e43d139d5570b718d566d8.jpeg "Why You’re Vibrating at the WRONG Frequency! ✅ Abraham Hicks 2025")

[ Why You’re Vibrating at the WRONG Frequency! ✅ Abraham Hicks 2025 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRpeuPJggp8&t=278)

So, Jesus Christ, Charles Hoskinson, and Abraham Hicks all seem to think that each and everyone of us deliberately create reality when we cultivate positive expectations about the things we want. And the negative space around that statement seems to indicate that those who’s expectations are based on what they are currently observing simply create more of what they observe.

Well I have the positive expectation that our community can make a back up copy of Charles and use it to help make good governance decisions and to help interpret the Cardano constitution long after Charles has lived a long wonderful life and has died a natural death surrounded by the people he loves most.

Fortunately Charles has made many videos which demonstrate his love for our community and which help define his personality, point of view, ideals and vision for Cardano.
So when I get the technique down for making chatbots that respond like a particular person, then I will certainly make one for Charles.

So far, I have a very good collection of python scripts that scrape YouTube and create transcripts, collect metadata, and build vector databases which can be used for fine-tuning an ai. The vector databases can also be used to by the a.i. to quote it’s sources. Recently I discovered [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) and [VideoRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/VideoRAG) which promise much better performance than can be achieved with the scripts I am currently using.
Everything will be open sourced on github as soon as the first working chatbot is produced.

I am so excited about the use and utility this project will provide.
Imagine if we could talk with the founding fathers of the United States concerning governance issues in general, and constitutionality issues in particular. Unfortunately they weren’t able to leave enough information about themselves to make this possible.

I think Charles has left enough already to accomplish the task and I have faith that he will leave a lot more.

## A Political Leader That Can’t Be Blackmailed, Kidnapped, Jailed, Or Assassinated

Charles has always wanted to hand over governance of the Cardano protocol to the community. It was his intention all along. But he also needed to do this for his own protection. Charles was a target for blackmail, kidnapping, and murder as long as he was in control of the protocol. Worse, he was a government target during a time when the deep-state/central-banks were trying to destroy crypto. Many of Charles’ contemporaries were jailed or murdered by various governments because of the cryptocurrency products they were building or for the services they provided. Charles had to disassociate himself from Cardano government in order to reduce incentive to target him personally. This was necessary, but it was also a loss for the community. A deep avatar of Charles with an eventual seat on the constitutional committee puts Charles back in a leadership position without any risk to him personally. And if the deep avatar is created and implemented in a decentralized manner, then it can’t be shut down, which is not the case with Charles himself. This is a win for Charles and it’s a win for the Cardano community. Venture capitalists are not going to like this idea.

An open source GitHub repository for the project has been setup.

## The perfect LLM has been selected for this project
**DeepSeek Prover-V2 7B: Formal Theorem Proving in Lean 4**

  - This LLM will be fine-tuned on the data collected to become a deep avatar of Charles.  
  - While not 100% open source, the [DeepSeek Prover-V2 7B: Formal Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://youtu.be/Y-bsdjB21DI?si=F_IE_eNrnWjpMoDZ) will likely be selected.
  - [Charles donated 20M to Carnegie Mellon University to open the Hoskinson center for formal mathematics which is focused on developing the Lean 4 Theorem Proving System](https://youtu.be/gCLJOrJFLZQ?si=KDRdKWIFGNrXlZFF&t=258).
  - He did this because he wants to embed soul and ethics into the Cardano protocol in a way that the system itself will understand.  
  - [The following is a direct quote from the video:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9wAyW_EcDA&t=1462s) "There's a question of how much should the ethics, the integrity the soul the intentions of the system be machine understandable? Because if their machine understandable you can then build protocols that can actually operate on the intent and embed them as kind of a regulator of the system for all smart contracts"
  - From this we can see that the DeepSeek Prover-V2 7B is likely the very LLM that Charles himself would select if he were doing this project.

While it is true that I have been working toward an a.i. system that replaces the Lean 4 Theorem Proving System, this LLM will likely give us the best of both!

[Deep-avatar](https://github.com/johnshearing/deep_avatar) based on [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) is taking shape quickly. 
Expect a deep avatar of Charles to participate in governance as a DRep soon!
