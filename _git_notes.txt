This directory named "lgt" corresponds to https://github.com/johnshearing/deep_avatar.git
Make all git commands from this directory not from the sub directories.

The following command shows where my backup remote repository currently exists and where the code originally came from:
(vrag_env) ~/lgt$ git remote -v
backup  https://github.com/johnshearing/deep_avatar.git (fetch)
backup  https://github.com/johnshearing/deep_avatar.git (push)


For more information about your remote repositories, issue the following commands:
git remote show backup
git remote show upstream


The following was the basic setup to make an online repository from this directory.
1. Create an empty online repository with whatever name you want.
   a. README.md and License files can be added later.

2. At the Bash console 
   Navigate to the top directory of the project using the "cd" command.
   For me the command is as folllows:
   cd lgt

   Remove the old git directory if it exists
   rm -rf .git

   If there are any .git directories in any of your subdirectories then these will not respond to git commands issued from the directory above.
   So delete any .git directories in your subdirectories if you wish to track those files from the repository above.
   cd <my subdirectory such as LightRAG or VideoRAG>
   rm -rf .git

   Navigate back to the top directory of the project using the "cd" command.
   For me the command is as folllows:
   cd lgt

   Initialize a new git repository after deleting the old.
   git init

   Rename the branch to "main":
   git branch -m main

   Create a selective .gitignore that ignores everything by default:
   echo "*" > .gitignore

   Take a look at the gitignore file as it currently exists to get an idea of what your gitignore files should look like.

   Stage and commit just these files:
   git add .gitignore
   git add -f important_script.py specific_folder/specific_file.py
   git commit -m "Initial commit with selected files only"


   Connect to your GitHub repository
   git remote add backup https://github.com/<your_account>/deep_avatar.git
   The following is an example of the command for my personal situation:
   git remote add backup https://github.com/johnshearing/deep_avatar.git

   Force push this clean state to GitHub:
   git push -f backup main

3. Now add the read me and the license to the online backup repository.

4. Then return to the bash console

   Pull the README.md and License files down to the local repository:
   git pull backup main

   Track the README and License files with the following commands, or just add the enteries to the gitignore file using a text editor
   Again, take a look at the gitignore file to see what it should look like.
   echo '!README.md' >> .gitignore
   echo '!LICENSE' >> .gitignore

   Gather files which are being tracked and have been changed to the stage to be committed.
   git add -A

   Commit the files to be tracked.
   git commit -m "Some comment here about the commit"

   Push the changes to the online repository:
   git push backup main
