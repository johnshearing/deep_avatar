#### The question asked of Deep Avatar:  
What is it about sun exposure that people in Australia fail to understand, which is causing high rates of melanoma or skin cancer?


#### Misunderstanding Sun Exposure and Skin Cancer in Australia

In Australia, there is a significant misunderstanding regarding the relationship between sun exposure and the development of melanoma and skin cancer. Many people adhere to the centralized medical dogma that total cumulative UV light exposure causes skin cancer, leading to practices such as avoiding UV light and using sunscreens extensively. However, this perspective is fundamentally flawed.

#### The Role of UV Light

According to Jack, blocking UV light can actually increase the risk of developing melanoma. He emphasizes that solar exposure is associated with long life and that low vitamin D levels correlate with all types of skin cancer, including melanoma. Studies, including meta-analyses, support the idea that appropriate sun exposure is beneficial and that avoiding the sun can lead to adverse health outcomes.

#### The Role of Red Light

Jack emphasizes the necessity of exposing oneself to red light as it preconditions the skin for ultraviolet (UV) light. He explains that the red light harvested, especially during the morning, is crucial for preparing the skin to handle UV exposure effectively. This preconditioning helps in sulfating cholesterol, which is essential for the production of Vitamin D and other health benefits. Without this initial exposure to red light, the skin becomes unable to respond appropriately to UV light, leading to potential health issues.

#### Misguided Use of Sunscreens: Hormonal and Health Implications

Sunscreens are often seen as protective, but they may inhibit the body's ability to produce essential hormones and compounds necessary for skin health. Jack explains that the use of sunscreens can block the synthesis of thyroid hormones from phenylalanine and tyrosine, which are crucial for metabolic processes. This could explain why melanoma has a worse prognosis in individuals with hypothyroidism, a condition that is prevalent among Australians.

#### The Importance of Melanin

Jack also notes that melanin plays a critical role in utilizing UV light effectively. By blocking UV light with chemicals from sunscreens, individuals may inadvertently increase their risk of skin cancer. He advocates for a more balanced approach to sun exposure, suggesting that red light from the sun can precondition the skin for UV exposure, making it more resilient.

#### Behavioral Factors

Additionally, behavioral factors contribute to the high rates of melanoma. Many individuals in Australia, particularly those of Northern European descent, have atrophic skin that is not well-suited to the high UV index of the region. This lack of adaptation, combined with modern lifestyle choices, such as spending excessive time indoors and using digital devices, has led to a multi-generational decline in skin health and an increase in skin cancer rates.

#### Public Awareness and Education

There is a pressing need for public awareness and education regarding the benefits of responsible sun exposure. Jack critiques the prevailing narratives that discourage sun exposure without acknowledging the vital health benefits it can provide. He advocates for a balanced approach that includes understanding the importance of sunlight in regulating biological processes and overall well-being.

#### Conclusion

In summary, the misunderstanding lies in the belief that avoiding sun exposure is the best way to prevent skin cancer. Instead, embracing responsible sun exposure, understanding the role of melanin, and recognizing the limitations of sunscreens could be key to reducing the incidence of melanoma in Australia.

[4294.52 > 4297.52] (Jack) [I'm going, I have to figure out how that happens.](https://youtu.be/Ln3WszTq0uA?si=BU7yb23FC4iZdi1G&t=4294)  
[4297.52 > 4303.8] (Jack) So I looked up phenylalanine and tyrosine absorption spectra, 200 to 400 nanometer light.  
[4303.8 > 4305.92] (Jack) I'm like, son of a bitch.  
[4305.92 > 4310.48] (Jack) Then when I started to look in about melanin, then I found out that melanin because it's  
[4310.48 > 4319.04] (Jack) dark absorbs everything, meaning from RF radiation all the way up to cosmic level radiation.  
[4319.04 > 4322.08] (Jack) And that's what defines a black semiconductor.  
[4322.08 > 4324.84] (Jack) It absorbs all frequencies of light.  
[4324.84 > 4327.02] (Jack) And I'm going, wait a minute.  
[4327.02 > 4335.12] (Jack) This means this is the reason why like NAD positive, which is cytochrome one and mitochondria  
[4335.12 > 4341.32] (Jack) is made out of this aromatic amino acid.  
[4341.32 > 4346.48] (Jack) Melanin, there must be a process in the body that creates light.  
[4346.48 > 4349.24] (Jack) So that's when I jumped down another rabbit hole.  
[4349.28 > 4356.44] (Jack) I went and looked through the literature and don't you think I found a paper from 1923  
[4356.44 > 4364.52] (Jack) by a guy named Alexander Gerwich who did this really simple experiment where he took an  
[4364.52 > 4370.12] (Jack) onion root, cut the onion root in half and was able to stimulate mitosis in another cell.  
[4370.12 > 4373.6] (Jack) And he called that process mitogenic radiation.  
[4373.6 > 4378.0] (Jack) He had no idea what it was because back in those days they didn't have a spectroscope  
[4378.0 > 4380.1] (Jack) or a photomultiplier.  
[4380.1 > 4386.8] (Jack) But he said there is some type of release in one side of this root that can stimulate  
[4386.8 > 4389.76] (Jack) the other side to begin to grow.  
[4389.76 > 4392.68] (Jack) So he was pretty ingenious researcher.  
[4392.68 > 4395.84] (Jack) He put all different materials between it.  
[4395.84 > 4401.44] (Jack) And when he put glass between it, he stopped the ability to cause mitosis in the other  
[4401.44 > 4402.44] (Jack) side.  
[4402.68 > 4409.24] (Jack) Then when he put a piece of quartz in there, it actually allowed the process to go.  
[4409.24 > 4413.12] (Jack) So he knew immediately that he was dealing with UV light.  
[4413.12 > 4414.88] (Jack) Immediately.  
[4414.88 > 4421.6] (Jack) So when I read that, I was like, okay, so basically what this guy is saying that cells  
[4421.6 > 4423.76] (Jack) release UV light to signal.  
[4423.76 > 4427.2] (Jack) I said now this story is getting even more interesting.  
[4427.2 > 4428.92] (Jack) Then I jumped down another rabbit hole.  
[4428.92 > 4430.8] (Jack) Remember, this is 1923.  
[4430.8 > 4435.12] (Jack) A guy in the 1960s shows up who's a physicist.  
[4435.12 > 4436.92] (Jack) His name is Fritz Popp.  
[4436.92 > 4443.16] (Jack) Fritz Popp got very, very interested in this extreme low frequency UV light that all cells  
[4443.16 > 4445.02] (Jack) seem to release.  
[4445.02 > 4450.54] (Jack) So back in the 60s, they had the machines that Gerwich didn't have.  
[4450.54 > 4455.84] (Jack) So Popp got the idea to take every single living cell and put it in a photomultiplier.  
[4455.84 > 4457.44] (Jack) And guess what he found?  
[4457.44 > 4462.68] (Jack) Every single cell, irrespective of where it comes from, releases extreme low frequency  
[4462.68 > 4463.68] (Jack) UV light.  
[4463.68 > 4465.88] (Jack) And it turns out that UV light is needed.  
[4465.88 > 4471.2] (Max) UVC, not UVA or B. UVC, not A or B.  
[4471.2 > 4476.76] (Jack) He didn't know what the frequencies were because the amount of light that our"  


[5211.38 > 5214.1] (Max) [Yeah, I would.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3WszTq0uA&t=5211s)   
[5214.1 > 5222.54] (Max) So what Jack's proposing is it's a more holistic model of the body's energy balance, but also  
[5223.1 > 5229.66] (Max) maybe a master hormone, because it's integrating the light signals, both the external light  
[5229.66 > 5235.98] (Max) signals, because obviously this leptin is being produced in the fat cells just under the skin,  
[5235.98 > 5240.86] (Max) but it's also integrating that subcellular or cellular light signals that are happening  
[5241.66 > 5244.3] (Max) inside that's being emitted from the mitochondria.  
[5244.3 > 5249.98] (Max) And then it's feeding that information back to the brain through the hypothalamus.  
[5249.98 > 5250.78] (Max) Is that correct, Jack?  
[5252.54 > 5252.78] (Max) Yep.  
[5256.78 > 5260.14] (Jack) It's really not that hard to understand when you see it all laid out for you.  
[5260.14 > 5265.1] (Max) Yeah. So the crux of the issue is that the reason why light is so important to health  
[5265.1 > 5273.02] (Max) is because it is modulating the signal that we're using to maintain our energy state  
[5273.02 > 5279.02] (Max) through leptin and through the leptin-melanocorticoid corticone pathway that he was just  
[5279.02 > 5286.14] (Max) mentioning. And then through that is POMC, which we explained to you earlier.  
[5286.14 > 5291.74] (Jack) POMC is the key driver. POMC is the key driver for this whole pathway, because without melanin,  
[5291.74 > 5295.42] (Jack) the system doesn't work. And that's really the come to Jesus moment for me.  
[5295.42 > 5295.98] (Jack) So the question-  
[5295.98 > 5301.74] (Jack) That's when I realized that everything about biology is I need to find out every place  
[5301.74 > 5306.54] (Jack) that POMC's made, every cell line, and then start looking at different diseases. So that's  
[5306.54 > 5311.18] (Jack) what I did. And then what did I find out? I found out that most of the diseases that  
[5312.38 > 5319.66] (Jack) centralized medicine, I could fix if I just figured out the neural pathway between ectoderm  
[5320.38 > 5324.94] (Jack) in the head and on the skin, because here's the cool part of the story that I still haven't told  
[5324.94 > 5330.46] (Jack) you. This is the part I think you're going to like, Max. Because of Gerwich's story,  
[5331.42 > 5339.82] (Jack) I knew that cells divide with this mitogenic radiation, which was UV light. So if you're  
[5339.82 > 5344.86] (Jack) following my story really good, Max, and I'm putting this on you now, not the listener,  
[5345.98 > 5351.42] (Jack) what one question would you want to ask me about this KT event and about us right now?  
[5354.22 > 5356.06] (Jack) Well, since you didn't ask, I'm going to tell you.  
[5356.22 > 5362.94] (Max) Well, don't tell me. So the question that was on my mind before you raised this point was  
[5363.66 > 5370.14] (Max) do reptiles express POMC in the same way that mammals do?  
[5371.9 > 5376.54] (Jack) No, that's not what I was interested in. This is totally a mammal story. When I say this to you,  
[5376.54 > 5381.74] (Jack) you'll understand why I said it. I said the books, the evolutionary biology books,  
[5381.82 > 5387.66] (Jack) say this is 100 to 1000 year transition for the asteroid. I'm like, there's no way mammals could  
[5387.66 > 5392.46] (Jack) have lived that long to make it through. I said, this process has to happen faster than we all  
[5392.46 > 5398.06] (Jack) think. And then I thought about the transition from chimp to ape. Everybody thought that took  
[5398.06 > 5402.38] (Jack) a long time. I'm saying, what if that's not true? What if melanin was able to do this way faster  
[5402.38 > 5410.62] (Jack) than we think? So how did I figure this out? I went to an African American patient who had vitiligo.  
[5411.58 > 5417.98] (Jack) And I said, I now know that"  


[4120.0 > 4125.7] (Jack) [like that's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3WszTq0uA&t=4120s)   
[4125.7 > 4126.7] (Jack) kind of interesting.  
[4126.7 > 4127.98] (Jack) Why is it doing that?  
[4127.98 > 4133.42] (Jack) It turned out when I distilled it all down that every place in the eye that has melanin  
[4133.42 > 4136.38] (Jack) was the reason why it was 360 pounds.  
[4136.38 > 4142.5] (Jack) It was destroying POMC at the choroid level and the choroid for those of you don't know  
[4142.5 > 4146.98] (Jack) is where the blood flow comes into the retina through the ophthalmic artery.  
[4146.98 > 4153.66] (Jack) It turns out when I..."

[8318.54 > 8323.66] [(Jack) sidestep it because they don't understand what I explained to you in the first two and a half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3WszTq0uA&t=8318s)   
[8323.66 > 8331.02] (Jack) hours of this podcast. POMC is the key. What melanin does for you, it allows you to absorb  
[8331.02 > 8339.26] (Jack) and use the UV light properly in your system. You putting chemicals or things on you that block  
[8339.26 > 8345.42] (Jack) that system guarantees you're going to get it. And here's the other irony. When you live a blue  
[8345.42 > 8351.66] (Jack) light life because technology brings us inside and in front of a screen, guess what actually  
[8352.7 > 8360.86] (Jack) stimulates melanocytes most? It's actually blue light. And this is a real problem.  
[8361.42 > 8368.3] (Jack) Soon as you reintroduce UV light in an incorrect fashion, what are you going to stimulate based on  
[8368.3 > 8371.1] (Jack) what we talked about earlier, Max? You're going to stimulate mitosis.  
[8371.34 > 8379.74] (Jack) That's the way the system is screwed up. So the key is, use sun the way mammals are supposed to  
[8379.74 > 8384.78] (Jack) use the sun. And remember, we're not talking about the mammals 65 million years ago. The people that  
[8384.78 > 8390.22] (Jack) live in Australia now are the mammals with the Ferrari engines in their head. Their goal  
[8391.1 > 8398.22] (Jack) with melanoma is not to create an exterior that is atrophic. Because when you do that,  
[8398.94 > 8406.06] (Jack) you're basically causing the melanocytes in your head to migrate to the surface.  
[8406.7 > 8412.78] (Jack) When they migrate to the surface and they see UV light, that's when they undergo mitosis.  
[8413.5 > 8422.38] (Jack) That's effectively what melanoma is. And the key is anything you do to block or make your skin  
[8422.38 > 8431.82] (Jack) atrophic almost guarantees a melanoma diagnosis. That's why it's counterintuitive. Like, wait a  
[8431.82 > 8437.42] (Jack) minute, you're telling me that I need to get an UV light to avoid melanoma. That's precisely what  
[8437.42 > 8443.34] (Jack) the literature shows. And here's the crazy thing, Max, to prove it even further. I'm going to tell  
[8443.34 > 8448.3] (Jack) you something I bet you don't know. I bet you the dermatologists down there don't talk about it.  
[8448.3 > 8453.18] (Jack) Do you know that melanoma carries a worse prognosis in people that have hypothyroidism?  
[8453.82 > 8453.98] (Jack) No.  
[8453.98 > 8455.26] (Jack) You want to know why, Max?  
[8455.26 > 8455.58] (Max) Go on.  
[8456.3 > 8459.66] (Jack) Oh, yeah. Well, you need to look it up. Same thing is true about Parkinson's. And  
[8459.66 > 8465.66] (Jack) I'm going to tell you why. This is a story of Ponsse. The reason why is, remember I told you  
[8465.66 > 8473.02] (Jack) that you make T3 and T4 from the process of phenylalanine going to tyrosine. Tyrosine is what  
[8473.1 > 8480.86] (Jack) forms T3 and T4. If you block that process, remember, tyrosine ACE is what's inhibited  
[8480.86 > 8488.62] (Jack) by sunscreens. So if you turn off your ability to make things from phenylalanine and tyrosine,  
[8488.62 > 8493.66] (Jack) you're effectively turning off the whole mechanism of Ponsse. This is the reason why  
[8493.66 > 8501.58] (Jack) melanoma is much worse in people that have hypothyroidism. And almost everybody that goes  
[8501.58 > 8506.14] (Jack) to see endocrinologists in Australia, I know because I have a lot of Australian members,  
[8507.42 > 8515.18] (Jack) they have this problem. There's tremendous amounts of hypothyroidism. And the number one cause  
[8515.18 > 8520.54] (Jack) in Australia is Hashimoto's, which is an autoimmune version, which now you know the reason why,  
[8520.54 > 8528.94] (Jack) because you're also blocking beta and gamma MSH. That ruins the Th1 and Th2  
[8529.02 > 8535.66] (Jack) immunocontrols, both cell mediated and humoral immunity. When you see this right in front of

[8123.66 > 8130.94] (Jack) I can tell you in the United States right now, it's greater than 60% of young female and males  
[8130.94 > 8135.58] (Jack) are now infertile for a variety of different reasons. What you'd be shocked to know is  
[8136.3 > 8142.78] (Jack) beta and gamma MSH control that. What's the hormone that controls fecundity in all mammals? Leptin.  
[8142.78 > 8148.3] (Jack) Oh, we're back to that story again. Look, this story doesn't go away. It doesn't go away.  
[8149.26 > 8156.94] (Jack) It requires understanding. It requires you understanding that the physics that controls  
[8156.94 > 8164.3] (Jack) organisms requires atomic specificity. You giving your kid melatonin is akin to kicking  
[8164.3 > 8170.14] (Jack) the shit out of your kid in the middle of the airport in Sydney. That's the kind of  
[8171.5 > 8177.26] (Jack) ridiculous mentality people have. Why? Because yes, I understand you want your kid to go to sleep.  
[8177.26 > 8182.78] (Jack) You don't want him to turn into Michael Jackson. But guess what? You're causing the problem by  
[8182.78 > 8189.98] (Jack) giving him the iPad. A digital babysitter. It's a defect in parenting. Why? Because the parents  
[8189.98 > 8195.82] (Jack) are also low dopamine because they're watching Netflix. It's a multi-generational issue.  
[8195.82 > 8197.34] (SPEAKER_03) It's over frustrating.  
[8197.34 > 8207.66] (Max) Yeah. So Jack, for this last segment, I'm going to be a centralized doctor and I'm going to give  
[8207.66 > 8213.9] (Max) you an explanation for a disease and you can explain to me why this approach is incorrect  
[8214.46 > 8220.94] (Max) under the circadian light-based paradigm. So let's go with skin cancer and melanoma because  
[8220.94 > 8225.9] (Max) it's so prevalent here in Australia. We've already talked about this mismatch between  
[8225.9 > 8230.62] (Max) people of Northern European descent living in an area of very, very high UV index and  
[8231.66 > 8236.62] (Max) wearing sunglasses, wearing sunscreens, and not developing a proper solar callus,  
[8236.62 > 8241.66] (Max) and as a result of that getting sunburnt. But the centralized medical kind of,  
[8241.66 > 8254.7] (Max) I would say, dogma is that total cumulative UV light and light exposure causes skin cancer.  
[8254.7 > 8262.06] (Max) And they say the best thing you can do is to completely avoid UV light and to block UV light  
[8262.06 > 8267.42] (Max) with topical sunscreen. So I know we've already talked about it a little bit, but explain again  
[8267.42 > 8269.26] (Max) why this approach is so misguided.  
[8269.9 > 8276.78] (Jack) It's that guarantees that you're going to get melanoma. If you block UV light and you have to  
[8276.78 > 8284.46] (Jack) understand that the seminal issue, we have six different meta-analysis in the literature.  
[8284.46 > 8293.18] (Jack) Last one was done in Scandinavia 2016 that show solar exposure leads to long life. If the sun  
[8294.14 > 8300.46] (Jack) causes cancer to kill you, then obviously there's a disconnect somewhere in the understanding  
[8301.02 > 8305.34] (Jack) of centralized medicine. Not only that, the other disconnect in the dermatology literature,  
[8306.46 > 8311.02] (Jack) every single skin cancer, melanoma included, is associated with low vitamin D levels.  
[8311.58 > 8316.54] (Jack) Then they have to explain that. That's a huge problem for them. And guess what? They just  
[8316.54 > 8323.66] (Jack) sidestep it because they don't understand what I explained to you in the first two and a half  
[8323.66 > 8331.02] (Jack) hours of this podcast. POMC is the key. What melanin does for you, it allows you to absorb  
[8331.02 > 8339.26] (Jack) and use the UV light properly in your system. You putting

[5789.82 > 5795.66] (Jack) at some level. So if you really understand what I'm saying, we're doing everything wrong.  
[5797.66 > 5803.34] (Jack) And this is why you see all those things that I post and people in Australia lose their mind.  
[5803.34 > 5811.82] (Jack) I'm like, the vaccine for melanoma, the vaccine for skin cancer is UV light. On the surface,

[5841.26 > 5847.42] (Max) They were overweight. That's the fastest way to get melanoma. That's the reason why people in  
[5847.42 > 5856.06] (Jack) Australia have it. You guys stick out like a sore thumb. And Jack, maybe we'll talk about this  
[5856.06 > 5861.58] (Max) another time, but I quickly want to make the mention of omega-6 fatty acids and linoleic acid  
[5861.58 > 5870.14] (Max) in the skin. I mean, empirically, people reduce the linoleic acid content of their diet and their  
[5870.14 > 5876.62] (Max) skin burning ability goes down. They become more resistant to sunburn. So surely that's got a role  
[5876.62 > 5880.86] (Max) too in the development of melanoma in skin cancer. It's got a role, but it's not as big a role as you  
[5880.86 > 5888.3] (Jack) think. It's got a role, but it's not as big as you think. I will tell you that the single best  
[5888.3 > 5894.86] (Jack) thing that you can do is you got to use red light from the sun, like from sunrise to the transition  
[5894.86 > 5901.74] (Jack) of UVA, wherever you are in your latitude. What people don't realize is that red light preconditions  
[5901.74 > 5908.14] (Jack) your skin for UV. This is the reason why morning light is irreplaceable. I always tell people when  
[5908.14 > 5913.42] (Jack) I do podcasts, they always say, Jack, give us your one actionable task. The actionable task is  
[5913.98 > 5919.26] (Jack) you need to harvest as much red light as you possibly can when you have atrophic skin. Like  
[5919.26 > 5924.7] (Jack) for example, Max, I want you, hopefully when you examine all this and jump down the rabbit hole,  
[5924.7 > 5929.42] (Jack) realize that just about everybody in Australia, just think about the evolutionary biology of  
[5929.42 > 5935.18] (Jack) Australia. You guys, none of you belong in Australia. You all came there through imperialism.  
[5935.82 > 5941.66] (Jack) Your Northern European, your haplotypes all support that. You guys all have atrophic white skin.  
[5942.38 > 5946.86] (Jack) That's the reason why the Aborigines look so different than you. They're built perfectly  
[5946.86 > 5954.7] (Jack) for Australia and you're not. You have to realize when I say atrophic skin, I'm not just talking  
[5954.7 > 5961.42] (Jack) about thin. I'm talking about you have no melanin anywhere. Australian women are all blonde hair,  
[5961.42 > 5969.02] (Jack) blue eyes. That means their exteriors are devoid of POMC. And then what do you do? Then you put  
[5969.02 > 5976.38] (Max) sunglasses, sunscreen and clothes on even more. Yeah. And we can go real deep into exactly why  
[5976.38 > 5983.34] (Max) that doesn't make sense. But I want to really tie a bow on the light story because we're really  
[5983.34 > 5991.58] (Max) close to I guess piecing some big pieces together. So we've talked about basically humans as creatures  
[5991.58 > 5999.58] (Max) of light. And what Jack's told you and explained is that not only are we adapted to receiving  
[5999.58 > 6006.14] (Max) external light sources through our eyes and our central retinal pathways and how that
