#### The question asked of Deep Avatar:  
According to Jack, How is parkinson's linked to melanoma and what single treatment could help both conditions?

#### Link Between Parkinson's Disease and Melanoma
Parkinson's Disease and melanoma are connected through the understanding of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene and its role in both conditions. 
Jack discusses how challenges in treating Parkinson's Disease are related to disruptions in the POMC pathway and autoimmune responses. 
He suggests that retinal damage and melanodisruption are linked to the development of Parkinson's Disease, indicating a biological connection between the two conditions.
Moreover, Jack states that melanoma carries a worse prognosis in individuals with hypothyroidism, which can complicate both conditions. 
He emphasizes that blocking the POMC pathway can lead to adverse outcomes in both melanoma and Parkinson's Disease, indicating a shared metabolic dysfunction that may exacerbate both conditions.

#### Potential Treatment for Both Conditions

Jack proposes that UV light exposure could be a potential treatment that benefits both Parkinson's Disease and melanoma. 
He argues that UV light plays a crucial role in stimulating the POMC gene, which is essential for proper biological functions. 
By enhancing melanin production through UV light, it may be possible to improve metabolic processes in the body that are linked to both conditions. 
Jack's insights suggest that utilizing UV light correctly could help restore the balance of POMC and melanin, potentially addressing issues related to both Parkinson's and melanoma. 
This approach contrasts with conventional treatments that often focus on blocking processes associated with these diseases.

#### Conclusion
In summary, the connection between Parkinson's Disease and melanoma lies in the POMC pathway and its implications for health. 
UV light exposure may serve as a beneficial treatment for both conditions by promoting melanin production and restoring metabolic balance.

#### The question asked of Deep Avatar:
According to Jack, why should people expose themselves to red light?

Jack emphasizes the necessity of exposing oneself to red light as it preconditions the skin for ultraviolet (UV) light. 
He explains that the red light harvested, especially during the morning, is crucial for preparing the skin to handle UV exposure effectively. 
This preconditioning helps in sulfating cholesterol, which is essential for the production of Vitamin D and other health benefits. 
Without this initial exposure to red light, the skin becomes unable to respond appropriately to UV light, leading to potential health issues.

\[4293.0 > 4297.52] (Jack) [I'm going, I have to figure out how that happens.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3WszTq0uA&t=4293s)
\[4297.52 > 4303.8] (Jack) So I looked up phenylalanine and tyrosine absorption spectra, 200 to 400 nanometer light.
\[4303.8 > 4305.92] (Jack) I'm like, son of a bitch.
\[4305.92 > 4310.48] (Jack) Then when I started to look in about melanin, then I found out that melanin because it's
\[4310.48 > 4319.04] (Jack) dark absorbs everything, meaning from RF radiation all the way up to cosmic level radiation.
\[4319.04 > 4322.08] (Jack) And that's what defines a black semiconductor.
\[4322.08 > 4324.84] (Jack) It absorbs all frequencies of light.
\[4324.84 > 4327.02] (Jack) And I'm going, wait a minute.
\[4327.02 > 4335.12] (Jack) This means this is the reason why like NAD positive, which is cytochrome one and mitochondria
\[4335.12 > 4341.32] (Jack) is made out of this aromatic amino acid.
\[4341.32 > 4346.48] (Jack) Melanin, there must be a process in the body that creates light.
\[4346.48 > 4349.24] (Jack) So that's when I jumped down another rabbit hole.
\[4349.28 > 4356.44] (Jack) I went and looked through the literature and don't you think I found a paper from 1923
\[4356.44 > 4364.52] (Jack) by a guy named Alexander Gerwich who did this really simple experiment where he took an
\[4364.52 > 4370.12] (Jack) onion root, cut the onion root in half and was able to stimulate mitosis in another cell.
\[4370.12 > 4373.6] (Jack) And he called that process mitogenic radiation.
\[4373.6 > 4378.0] (Jack) He had no idea what it was because back in those days they didn't have a spectroscope
\[4378.0 > 4380.1] (Jack) or a photomultiplier.
\[4380.1 > 4386.8] (Jack) But he said there is some type of release in one side of this root that can stimulate
\[4386.8 > 4389.76] (Jack) the other side to begin to grow.
\[4389.76 > 4392.68] (Jack) So he was pretty ingenious researcher.
\[4392.68 > 4395.84] (Jack) He put all different materials between it.
\[4395.84 > 4401.44] (Jack) And when he put glass between it, he stopped the ability to cause mitosis in the other
\[4401.44 > 4402.44] (Jack) side.
\[4402.68 > 4409.24] (Jack) Then when he put a piece of quartz in there, it actually allowed the process to go.
\[4409.24 > 4413.12] (Jack) So he knew immediately that he was dealing with UV light.
\[4413.12 > 4414.88] (Jack) Immediately.
\[4414.88 > 4421.6] (Jack) So when I read that, I was like, okay, so basically what this guy is saying that cells
\[4421.6 > 4423.76] (Jack) release UV light to signal.
\[4423.76 > 4427.2] (Jack) I said now this story is getting even more interesting.
\[4427.2 > 4428.92] (Jack) Then I jumped down another rabbit hole.
\[4428.92 > 4430.8] (Jack) Remember, this is 1923.
\[4430.8 > 4435.12] (Jack) A guy in the 1960s shows up who's a physicist.
\[4435.12 > 4436.92] (Jack) His name is Fritz Popp.
\[4436.92 > 4443.16] (Jack) Fritz Popp got very, very interested in this extreme low frequency UV light that all cells
\[4443.16 > 4445.02] (Jack) seem to release.
\[4445.02 > 4450.54] (Jack) So back in the 60s, they had the machines that Gerwich didn't have.
\[4450.54 > 4455.84] (Jack) So Popp got the idea to take every single living cell and put it in a photomultiplier.
\[4455.84 > 4457.44] (Jack) And guess what he found?
\[4457.44 > 4462.68] (Jack) Every single cell, irrespective of where it comes from, releases extreme low frequency
\[4462.68 > 4463.68] (Jack) UV light.
\[4463.68 > 4465.88] (Jack) And it turns out that UV light is needed.
\[4465.88 > 4471.2] (Max) UVC, not UVA or B. UVC, not A or B.
\[4471.2 > 4476.76] (Jack) He didn't know what the frequencies were because the amount of light that our

**ID 1**
\[5211.38 > 5214.1] (Max) [Yeah, I would.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3WszTq0uA&t=5211s)
\[5214.1 > 5222.54] (Max) So what Jack's proposing is it's a more holistic model of the body's energy balance, but also
\[5223.1 > 5229.66] (Max) maybe a master hormone, because it's integrating the light signals, both the external light
\[5229.66 > 5235.98] (Max) signals, because obviously this leptin is being produced in the fat cells just under the skin,
\[5235.98 > 5240.86] (Max) but it's also integrating that subcellular or cellular light signals that are happening
\[5241.66 > 5244.3] (Max) inside that's being emitted from the mitochondria.
\[5244.3 > 5249.98] (Max) And then it's feeding that information back to the brain through the hypothalamus.
\[5249.98 > 5250.78] (Max) Is that correct, Jack?
\[5252.54 > 5252.78] (Max) Yep.
\[5256.78 > 5260.14] (Jack) It's really not that hard to understand when you see it all laid out for you.
\[5260.14 > 5265.1] (Max) Yeah. So the crux of the issue is that the reason why light is so important to health
\[5265.1 > 5273.02] (Max) is because it is modulating the signal that we're using to maintain our energy state
\[5273.02 > 5279.02] (Max) through leptin and through the leptin-melanocorticoid corticone pathway that he was just
\[5279.02 > 5286.14] (Max) mentioning. And then through that is POMC, which we explained to you earlier.
\[5286.14 > 5291.74] (Jack) POMC is the key driver. POMC is the key driver for this whole pathway, because without melanin,
\[5291.74 > 5295.42] (Jack) the system doesn't work. And that's really the come to Jesus moment for me.
\[5295.42 > 5295.98] (Jack) So the question-
\[5295.98 > 5301.74] (Jack) That's when I realized that everything about biology is I need to find out every place
\[5301.74 > 5306.54] (Jack) that POMC's made, every cell line, and then start looking at different diseases. So that's
\[5306.54 > 5311.18] (Jack) what I did. And then what did I find out? I found out that most of the diseases that
\[5312.38 > 5319.66] (Jack) centralized medicine, I could fix if I just figured out the neural pathway between ectoderm
\[5320.38 > 5324.94] (Jack) in the head and on the skin, because here's the cool part of the story that I still haven't told
\[5324.94 > 5330.46] (Jack) you. This is the part I think you're going to like, Max. Because of Gerwich's story,
\[5331.42 > 5339.82] (Jack) I knew that cells divide with this mitogenic radiation, which was UV light. So if you're
\[5339.82 > 5344.86] (Jack) following my story really good, Max, and I'm putting this on you now, not the listener,
\[5345.98 > 5351.42] (Jack) what one question would you want to ask me about this KT event and about us right now?
\[5354.22 > 5356.06] (Jack) Well, since you didn't ask, I'm going to tell you.
\[5356.22 > 5362.94] (Max) Well, don't tell me. So the question that was on my mind before you raised this point was
\[5363.66 > 5370.14] (Max) do reptiles express POMC in the same way that mammals do?
\[5371.9 > 5376.54] (Jack) No, that's not what I was interested in. This is totally a mammal story. When I say this to you,
\[5376.54 > 5381.74] (Jack) you'll understand why I said it. I said the books, the evolutionary biology books,
\[5381.82 > 5387.66] (Jack) say this is 100 to 1000 year transition for the asteroid. I'm like, there's no way mammals could
\[5387.66 > 5392.46] (Jack) have lived that long to make it through. I said, this process has to happen faster than we all
\[5392.46 > 5398.06] (Jack) think. And then I thought about the transition from chimp to ape. Everybody thought that took
\[5398.06 > 5402.38] (Jack) a long time. I'm saying, what if that's not true? What if melanin was able to do this way faster
\[5402.38 > 5410.62] (Jack) than we think? So how did I figure this out? I went to an African American patient who had vitiligo.
\[5411.58 > 5417.98] (Jack) And I said, I now know that

[5396.06 > 5402.38] (Jack) [a long time. I'm saying, what if that's not true?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3WszTq0uA&t=5396s) What if melanin was able to do this way faster
[5402.38 > 5410.62] (Jack) than we think? So how did I figure this out? I went to an African American patient who had vitiligo.
[5411.58 > 5417.98] (Jack) And I said, I now know that I can repigment your skin. I just need to know how fast it can happen.
[5417.98 > 5423.9] (Jack) I said, would you agree to let me try to repigment your skin? And I went to one of my
[5423.9 > 5429.5] (Jack) dermatology colleagues and I said, send me a patient that you're having a lot of trouble with.
[5430.46 > 5435.9] (Jack) And she did. And if you follow my work, any of my blogs, there's this picture of this lady that
[5435.9 > 5443.1] (Jack) I always show. And she was African American overweight woman who had gray hair. Her hair
[5443.1 > 5448.94] (Jack) was shaved, but she had really bad facial vitiligo. In six weeks, I fixed her.
[5448.94 > 5453.66] (Max) And vitiligo for the listeners, loss of melanin, loss of pigmentation in the skin.
[5454.46 > 5459.5] (Jack) Just think about Michael Jackson. That's the easiest way to think about it. It's basically
[5459.5 > 5465.74] (Jack) the story of Michael Jackson. And in this lady's history, I found that she used sunscreen all
[5465.74 > 5472.14] (Jack) the time. She always used sunglasses, hardly ever went out with her surface exposed. And the crazy
[5472.14 > 5478.86] (Jack) thing is when I used the UV light to bring the melanocytes back in, she also had some metabolic
[5478.86 > 5484.86] (Jack) issues and those metabolic issues were made worse. And I thought, oh, this is unusual. And then I
[5484.86 > 5489.5] (Jack) thought about it. I said, no, it's not. I said, now I think I really figured it out. She was actually
[5489.5 > 5495.5] (Jack) pulling the melanocytes from inside her head out to the skin where the UV light was. And I said,
[5495.5 > 5500.22] (Jack) that means there's neuroplasticity between the neuroactiderm. I said, and the reason that she
[5500.22 > 5506.46] (Jack) got metabolically worse is because she didn't have enough palm seed on the inside. So I knew
[5506.46 > 5512.14] (Jack) immediately that this could happen really fast. So I told her implicitly, I said, look, now that
[5512.14 > 5517.02] (Jack) we've repigmented your skin, if you continue to stay in the sun like you've done, and obviously
[5517.02 > 5521.66] (Jack) I had buy-in now because the number one problem she went to the dermatologist was she didn't like
[5521.66 > 5525.74] (Jack) the way her face looked. I said, look, I think I can make your diabetes and your obesity go away
[5525.74 > 5530.78] (Jack) if you continue to stay in the sun and we can rebuild the palm seed in your hypothalamus through
[5530.78 > 5537.66] (Jack) this leptin-melanocortin pathway. Well, guess what? She wound up losing 80 pounds and her type 2
[5537.66 > 5544.14] (Jack) diabetes went completely away. The other crazy part of the story, I didn't anticipate this,
[5544.14 > 5549.58] (Jack) I told you she had gray hair on the picture that I always show. Her hair got melanin back in it,
[5549.58 > 5557.02] (Jack) so it was dark. So I realized right away that the things that we learned in neurosurgery,
[5557.02 > 5561.58] (Jack) at least I learned, you're younger than me, I learned that neuroactiderm didn't have a lot
[5561.58 > 5567.74] (Jack) of neuroplasticity. It turned out that it does. We now know definitively in the last 10 or 15 years
[5567.74 > 5574.14] (Jack) that the adult brain is way more plastic than we think. But the thing that I found out is that
[5574.14 > 5582.62] (Jack) melanin is super-duper inducible with UV light. That answered the question for me that I had
[5582.62 > 5589.82] (Jack) with the mammals. I said, that means as soon as they came out when the dinosaurs were dead,
[5590.38

[8317.54 > 8323.66] (Jack) [sidestep it because they don't understand what I explained to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3WszTq0uA&t=8317s) in the first two and a half
[8323.66 > 8331.02] (Jack) hours of this podcast. POMC is the key. What melanin does for you, it allows you to absorb
[8331.02 > 8339.26] (Jack) and use the UV light properly in your system. You putting chemicals or things on you that block
[8339.26 > 8345.42] (Jack) that system guarantees you're going to get it. And here's the other irony. When you live a blue
[8345.42 > 8351.66] (Jack) light life because technology brings us inside and in front of a screen, guess what actually
[8352.7 > 8360.86] (Jack) stimulates melanocytes most? It's actually blue light. And this is a real problem.
[8361.42 > 8368.3] (Jack) Soon as you reintroduce UV light in an incorrect fashion, what are you going to stimulate based on
[8368.3 > 8371.1] (Jack) what we talked about earlier, Max? You're going to stimulate mitosis.
[8371.34 > 8379.74] (Jack) That's the way the system is screwed up. So the key is, use sun the way mammals are supposed to
[8379.74 > 8384.78] (Jack) use the sun. And remember, we're not talking about the mammals 65 million years ago. The people that
[8384.78 > 8390.22] (Jack) live in Australia now are the mammals with the Ferrari engines in their head. Their goal
[8391.1 > 8398.22] (Jack) with melanoma is not to create an exterior that is atrophic. Because when you do that,
[8398.94 > 8406.06] (Jack) you're basically causing the melanocytes in your head to migrate to the surface.
[8406.7 > 8412.78] (Jack) When they migrate to the surface and they see UV light, that's when they undergo mitosis.
[8413.5 > 8422.38] (Jack) That's effectively what melanoma is. And the key is anything you do to block or make your skin
[8422.38 > 8431.82] (Jack) atrophic almost guarantees a melanoma diagnosis. That's why it's counterintuitive. Like, wait a
[8431.82 > 8437.42] (Jack) minute, you're telling me that I need to get an UV light to avoid melanoma. That's precisely what
[8437.42 > 8443.34] (Jack) the literature shows. And here's the crazy thing, Max, to prove it even further. I'm going to tell
[8443.34 > 8448.3] (Jack) you something I bet you don't know. I bet you the dermatologists down there don't talk about it.
[8448.3 > 8453.18] (Jack) Do you know that melanoma carries a worse prognosis in people that have hypothyroidism?
[8453.82 > 8453.98] (Jack) No.
[8453.98 > 8455.26] (Jack) You want to know why, Max?
[8455.26 > 8455.58] (Max) Go on.
[8456.3 > 8459.66] (Jack) Oh, yeah. Well, you need to look it up. Same thing is true about Parkinson's. And
[8459.66 > 8465.66] (Jack) I'm going to tell you why. This is a story of Ponsse. The reason why is, remember I told you
[8465.66 > 8473.02] (Jack) that you make T3 and T4 from the process of phenylalanine going to tyrosine. Tyrosine is what
[8473.1 > 8480.86] (Jack) forms T3 and T4. If you block that process, remember, tyrosine ACE is what's inhibited
[8480.86 > 8488.62] (Jack) by sunscreens. So if you turn off your ability to make things from phenylalanine and tyrosine,
[8488.62 > 8493.66] (Jack) you're effectively turning off the whole mechanism of Ponsse. This is the reason why
[8493.66 > 8501.58] (Jack) melanoma is much worse in people that have hypothyroidism. And almost everybody that goes
[8501.58 > 8506.14] (Jack) to see endocrinologists in Australia, I know because I have a lot of Australian members,
[8507.42 > 8515.18] (Jack) they have this problem. There's tremendous amounts of hypothyroidism. And the number one cause
[8515.18 > 8520.54] (Jack) in Australia is Hashimoto's, which is an autoimmune version, which now you know the reason why,
[8520.54 > 8528.94] (Jack) because you're also blocking beta and gamma MSH. That ruins the Th1 and Th2
[8529.02 > 8535.66] (Jack) immunocontrols, both cell mediated and humoral immunity. When you see this right in front of
[8535.66 >

[5568.14 > 5574.14] (Jack) [that the adult brain is way more plastic than we think.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln3WszTq0uA&t=5568s) But the thing that I found out is that
[5574.14 > 5582.62] (Jack) melanin is super-duper inducible with UV light. That answered the question for me that I had
[5582.62 > 5589.82] (Jack) with the mammals. I said, that means as soon as they came out when the dinosaurs were dead,
[5590.38 > 5596.46] (Jack) they started pulling their melanin inside their brains. That's what fueled mammalian brain
[5596.46 > 5599.5] (Jack) evolution. And you remember, I'm a brain surgeon. That's what I'm interested in.
[5600.22 > 5606.94] (Jack) That absolutely blew my mind. And then I immediately jumped 65 million years in advance.
[5606.94 > 5613.42] (Jack) And I said, this explains the transition to chimp to human. Because we shouldn't, if I'm right about
[5613.42 > 5620.14] (Jack) this, we shouldn't have a big change in our genes at all. And it turned out when the Human Genome
[5620.14 > 5627.18] (Jack) Project came out in 96, we didn't. We had exactly the same number. And that's when I realized that
[5628.14 > 5634.7] (Jack) the game here was we had to pull from our surface. Like any disease where you're pulling
[5634.7 > 5640.54] (Jack) melanin from inside your head to outside is going to be devastating. That's exactly what MS is doing.
[5640.54 > 5646.94] (Jack) That's exactly what melanoma is. I mean, if you really understand this, melanoma is melanin cells
[5646.94 > 5653.18] (Jack) in your brain coming to the surface because you can't create any VUV light deep inside your head
[5653.98 > 5659.34] (Jack) because the system is completely broken because you've blocked it for so long.
[5659.34 > 5663.98] (Jack) And here's the crazy part, Max, because I know there's going to be other doctors that listen to
[5663.98 > 5669.34] (Jack) this. And I'm sure you're listening to this. And this is beyond your belief. But I'm going to prove
[5669.34 > 5675.42] (Jack) to you just how correct I am that this process still works in you. You learned in medical school
[5675.9 > 5683.1] (Jack) a thing about white blood cells called diapodesis, correct? Yeah, yeah, yeah, the process of...
[5684.7 > 5688.46] (Jack) So do you know why white blood cells are able to migrate into tissues?
[5689.1 > 5694.54] (Jack) It's exactly the same thing as metastasis does. Do you know how it happens? You may not know this,
[5694.54 > 5703.18] (Jack) but white blood cells are loaded with POMC. And it turns out cytoplasm where POMC is located gets
[5703.18 > 5709.42] (Jack) turned off in these cells so that allows them to migrate. In other words, cells cannot migrate
[5710.22 > 5718.7] (Jack) unless mitosis is turned off. That means you have to turn off UV light release to maintain
[5718.7 > 5725.66] (Jack) neuroplasticity. This is still seen in our immune cells today. And guess what happens when
[5726.38 > 5734.06] (Jack) the white blood cell gets to the tissue where the bacteria is emitting light, that emission of light
[5734.06 > 5740.7] (Jack) activates mitosis in the white cell to clear the infection. That's actually how it works.
[5740.7 > 5750.86] (Jack) So I realized right away that metastasis is actually a mammalian innovation. And we use it
[5750.94 > 5757.34] (Jack) in our immune system to this very day. And the evidence is still present in our melanocytes
[5757.34 > 5762.46] (Jack) because we can move our melanocytes. But here's why this is such a counterintuitive thing.
[5763.1 > 5769.66] (Jack) You know that the paradigm of cancer in centralized medicine is that, well, mitosis is bad in cancer.
