Creating a.i. avatars which likely give the same answers as the person for which they are modeled.  

The first deep avatar will be modeled after Abraham Hicks.  
The the second deep avatar will be modeled after Charles Hoskinson.  

The main building block is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system.  
This is a system for automatically collecting data such as videos and documents created by the human model over the course of their lifetime.  
The RAG system is used to create training data for fine-tuneing an LLM so as to give the same answers as the human model when provided with the same questions.  
The RAG system also allows the deep avatar to give accurate answers and to quote sources.  
The open source repositories VideoRag and LightRAG are being used to build the RAG system.  
Current progress is at Step 1.  

I chose Abraham Hicks as my first subject because I wanted a way to find relevant sections from of all the thousands of Abraham Hicks videos by using natural language queries.  
Soon I realized it would be very benificial if people could talk with Abraham directly even if Esther Hicks is not available.  
The deep avatar of Abraham will first be accessed with a keyboard at the terminal, but soon after, speech to speech access will be available.  
It will also be quite easy to add a video representation of the deep avatar so that the user has someone pleasant to look at while chatting.  

I chose Charles Hoskinson as my second subject because he is the founder of Cardano and I thought I would be wonderful if the Cardano community could always have his guidance. Imagine if we could talk with the founding fathers of the United States concerning governance issues in general, and constitutionality issues in particular. Unfortunately they werenâ€™t able to leave enough information about themselves to make this possible. I think Charles has left enough already to accomplish the task and I have faith that he will live a long time and leave a lot more. Charles made a 20 million dollar donation to Carnegie Mellon to work on a method of coding the Cardano constitution into a smart contract. The idea was to use this smart contract to allow or dissallow other smart contract to be deployed base on whether or not they are determined to be constitutional. But my previous work in both funtional programming and artificial intelligence has taught me that a.i. is likely the best path to achiveing a machine understandable constitution that can validate smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. Ultimately I am immagining that a deep avatar of Charles Hoskinson will run for a seat on the constitutional committee which is decided by a community wide election.

Charles has always wanted to hand over governance of the Cardano protocol to the community. It was his intention all along. But he also needed to do this for his own protection. Charles was target for blackmail, kiddnapping, and murder as long as he was in control of the protocol. Worse, he was a government target during a time when the deep-state/central-banks were trying to destroy crypto. Many of Charles' contemperaries were jailed or murdered by various governments because of the crytocurrency products they were building. Charles had to disaccociate himself from Cardano government in order to reduce the incentive to target him personally. This was necessary, but it was also a loss for the community.
