Step 1. Load the LightRAG index with metadata about the video. (URL, title, channel, upload date, etc)
        Load the LightRAG index with entities to represent the categories.

Step 2. Load the LightRAG index with the video transcript.

Step 3. Inspect the indexed data, and clean the source txt of duplicate entities with slightly different spellings and also mis-spellings from the transcribed audio.

Step 4. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 until the data is clean.

Step 5. With clean transcripts it is now possible to add the metadata and transcript to an index with multiple source documents.

Step 6. Add category entities to the index of source documents.

Step 7. Use any a.i. to match the entities captured from the video transcript with the categories. 


Step 1 in detail:
Using _1_custom_index_01.py apply _1_Ln3WszTq0uA_metadata.json or a similar file.
This creates metadata entities in the index about the video from which the transcript originates.

Step 2 in detail:
Using _1_doc_index_01.py apply _3_Ln3WszTq0uA_truncated.txt or similar file to the index.
This indexes the video transcript.

Step 3 in detail:
The a.i. will do a very good job of indexing the video transcript but not a perfect job.
Using _1_merge_GUI_58.py and the LightRAG WebUI, inspect the indexed data.
Clean the source txt of duplicate entities with slightly different spellings (make them all the same)
Also fix all the mis-spellings from the transcribed audio.
It will not be required to fix any data in the ????_metadata.json files. So keep these files in a separate folder from the video transcripts.

The using the regex function in the find and replace tab of the VS Code IDE is ideal for cleaning up the transcripts. 
Put all the transcripts in a single folder and set the "files to include" filter to look only in this folder and to only look in .txt files.
Set the files to exclude filter to ".json" so as to be sure the metadata files are not changed.

In the search box enter a regex as in the following example:
(Pollack|Dr. Pollack|Gerald Pollack|Dr. Gerald Pollack)
###  This is required   ###
Notice we specify the shorter names first in the search term above. 
###  This is required   ###

The following regex example will be handy. 
It will find the term Pollack but will not find the term (Pollack)
(?<!\()Pollack(?!\))


Step 4 in detail:
Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 until the data is clean.

Step 5 in detail:
With clean transcripts it is now possible to add the metadata and transcript to an index with multiple source documents.

Step 6 in detail:
Add category entities to the index of source documents.
Use _1_custom_cat_generate_01.py to generate a json file of all desired categories.
then use _1_custom_index_01.py to add the categories as new entities in the index.

Step 7 in detail:
Look in prompt.py for the category descriptions.
Using the LighRAG server API get a list of all the entities.

Using information from the above, ask any ai the following query and put the output in a file like _4_Ln3WszTq0uA_category_matches_a.json.

Notice that that _4_Ln3WszTq0uA_category_matches_a.json only contains the relationships for entities that start with the letter a.
This is so that the ai does not quit in the middle of the process because the free token limit has been exceeded. 
It will be required to make a json file for each letter. 
In the alternative you can purchase tokens with an API key in which case the a.i. will likely catagorize all the entities in one shot without quiting.

Once you have the file _4_Ln3WszTq0uA_category_matches_a.json then use _1_custom_index_01.py to index that file.
This creates a relationship in the LightRAG index between every entity and any categories each entity may fall into.
Repeat this process with entities that start with other letters.


##################   The following is the a.i. prompt to match entities with categories   ####################

Greetings Grok, Gemini, Claude, or whatever a.i. I am asking for help.
I have a list of categories pasted below, and below that I have a list of entities which might be considered members of one or more of those categories. 
For entities which fall into one or more of the categories I need to create a json entry that documents the relationships as in the following example.
Would you please create the requied json?

{
    "relationships": [
        {
            "src_id": "place",
            "tgt_id": "Alabama",
            "description": "Alabama is a member of the category place",
            "keywords": "Alabama, element of, place",
            "weight": 7.0,
            "source_id": "category_data.json"
        },
        {
            "src_id": "event",
            "tgt_id": "Asteroid Event",
            "description": "Asteroid Event is a member of the category event",
            "keywords": "Asteroid Event, element of, event",
            "weight": 7.0,
            "source_id": "category_data.json"
        },
        {
            "src_id": "organization",
            "tgt_id": "Big Pharma",
            "description": "Big Pharma is a member of the category organization",
            "keywords": "Big Pharma, element of, organization",
            "weight": 7.0,
            "source_id": "category_data.json"
        },
                {
            "src_id": "complex_adaptive_system",
            "tgt_id": "Big Pharma",
            "description": "Big Pharma is a member of the category complex_adaptive_system",
            "keywords": "Big Pharma, element of, complex_adaptive_system",
            "weight": 7.0,
            "source_id": "category_data.json"
        }
    ]
}


Please notice how some of the entities may be members of many categories.
