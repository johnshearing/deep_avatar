Using _1_custom_index_01.py apply _1_Ln3WszTq0uA_metadata.json and _2_Ln3WszTq0uA_categories.json

Using _1_doc_index_01.py apply _3_Ln3WszTq0uA_truncated.txt

Look in prompt.py for the category descriptions.
Using the LighRAG server API get a list of all the entities.

Ask any ai the following and put the output in a file like _4_Ln3WszTq0uA_category_matches_a.json
Notice that that _4_Ln3WszTq0uA_category_matches_a.json only contains the entities that start with the letter a.
This is so that the ai does not get overloaded. 
It will be required to make a file for each letter. 
Or the process can be automated with an agent.
Once you have the file _4_Ln3WszTq0uA_category_matches_a.json then use _1_custom_index_01.py to index the file.
This creates a relationship between every entity and any categories the entity may fall into.

Greetings,
I have a list of categories pasted below, and below that I have a list of entities which might be considered members of one or more of those categories. 
For entities which fall into one or more of the categories I need to create a json entry that documents the relationships as in the following example.
Would you please create the requied json?

{
    "relationships": [
        {
            "src_id": "place",
            "tgt_id": "Alabama",
            "description": "Alabama is a member of the category place",
            "keywords": "Alabama, element of, place",
            "weight": 7.0,
            "source_id": "category_data.json"
        },
        {
            "src_id": "event",
            "tgt_id": "Asteroid Event",
            "description": "Asteroid Event is a member of the category event",
            "keywords": "Asteroid Event, element of, event",
            "weight": 7.0,
            "source_id": "category_data.json"
        },
        {
            "src_id": "organization",
            "tgt_id": "Big Pharma",
            "description": "Big Pharma is a member of the category organization",
            "keywords": "Big Pharma, element of, organization",
            "weight": 7.0,
            "source_id": "category_data.json"
        },
                {
            "src_id": "complex_adaptive_system",
            "tgt_id": "Big Pharma",
            "description": "Big Pharma is a member of the category complex_adaptive_system",
            "keywords": "Big Pharma, element of, complex_adaptive_system",
            "weight": 7.0,
            "source_id": "category_data.json"
        }
    ]
}


Please notice how some of the entities may be members of many categories.
Would you please generate the required json?
