Many of us in the Cardano community have supported this project throughout the years simply because we trust Charles. We trust his ability to make good decisions about what to build and how to build. And we trust that he is motivated by a love for all the people in the Cardano community.

So what I want is a DRep that I am certain will support Charles' vision for Cardano and who will vote to fund his work. I could delegate to a DRep that will promise to do this but how do I know what they will do over time after I have stopped paying attention to each vote? And how can my DRep even know how Charles would vote on a given proposal when he doesn't weigh in on each and every one of them? 

[In this video clip](https://www.youtube.com/live/9xf-RcWQLDI?si=54SSaDOxEmF8WPx3&t=2230) we see that Charles is relying on AI to help him make important decisions about the tokenonmics of the Midnight protocol. He mentions he is using a RAG system. That stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. It's a special database that an ai large language model can use to answer questions about information they were never trained on. This could be new information, niche information, or private information.  

The video linked above is 3 hours and 30 minutes long. I am sure he talks about all kinds of things over the course of the video but if he says anything about how he wants the DReps to vote and explains why, then I want my DRep to know what he says and to vote accordingly. 

[I have built a simple RAG AI system](https://github.com/johnshearing/deep_avatar) that will look through all Charles' videos, index all the things he says, and then answer questions about Cardano governance proposals in the same way Charles would answer even if Charles has never discussed that issue. I would like this ai to serve as my DRep because I know it will always cast it's vote in the same way Charles would vote if given the same information on that same issue.

There are many problems to solve before my ai DRep will be ready to participate in governance, but things will fall into place soon enough. Below is an example of what has already been accomplished. I asked the ai to look through the very long video that I mentioned above and then tell me what Charles said about the upcoming budget vote.

> Question:
> "In the video with [YouTube ID 9xf-RcWQLDI](https://www.youtube.com/live/9xf-RcWQLDI?si=oEBqG8gfazEHN9On) where Charles Hoskinson is speaking, what specifically is Charles asking the Cardano community to vote for on behalf of his company IOG when the community votes on the budget proposal? What points does Charles express in the video in order to convince the voters to grant his request? 
> 
> ðŸ§  Answer:
> In the video featuring Charles Hoskinson ([YouTube ID: 9xf-RcWQLDI](https://www.youtube.com/live/9xf-RcWQLDI?si=oEBqG8gfazEHN9On)), he addresses the Cardano community regarding the budget proposal and emphasizes the importance of supporting his company, Input Output Global (IOG), through their voting process. He articulates the need for ongoing funding and strategic direction to sustain development and enhance transparency in Cardano's governance framework.
> 
> ### Key Points Charles Expresses:
> 
> 1. **Track Record and Progress**: Charles highlights the achievements of IOG and the development progress of Cardano. He mentions, "Overall, Iâ€™m pretty proud of the record that we have", underpinning his argument with a sense of accountability and success in past initiatives.
> 
> 2. **Community Concerns**: He acknowledges community sentiments regarding governance, where he states that critiques about governance led to portrayals of IOG as "evil" or "malicious" . Charles vehemently defends IOG's integrity, addressing concerns about reputation and fostering a more positive narrative.
> 
> 3. **Importance of Financial Support**: He articulates the necessity of fiscal conservatism, suggesting that the treasury holds enough funds to support substantial projects, acknowledging that "there's plenty of money in the Treasury" and outlining that ongoing support is crucial for future development
> 
> 4. **Vision for Future**: Charles emphasizes the upcoming developments and initiatives that necessitate community backing, indicating that this investment is vital for leveraging the potential of Cardano for future opportunities and challenges.
> 
> Throughout the video, his overarching message is about fostering trust and collaboration between IOG and the Cardano community, reinforcing that a vote in favor of the budget proposal sets a precedent for future success and sustainable growth in the ecosystem.

It seems to me, if Charles is using an RAG AI system to figure out a complex issue like best tokenomics for Midnight, then we should be able to use an AI RAG system to figure out how Charles would vote on governance proposals and then cast that vote. 

This will help ensure good governance for the Cardano community well into the future.
